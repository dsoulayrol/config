My shared configuration. -- David Soulayrol <david.soulayrol@gmail.com>

1. Awesome

This Awesome configuration relies on flaw
(http://github.com/dsoulayrol/flaw). Before using the configuration,
these commands must be entered once:

git submodule init
git submodule update

A specific version of flaw will be cloned into awesome/flaw. Git only
tracks this very version, so to let him track the most recent one,
enter the following commands:

cd awesome/flaw
git remote update
git merge origin/master

(See the very good tutorial on
 http://woss.name/2008/04/09/using-git-submodules-to-track-vendorrails/)
